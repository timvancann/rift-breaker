# Rift Breaker

Rift Breaker is an open source game created in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/). It draws inspiration from excellent rogue-like bullet hell games such as [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) and [Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/).

It is intented as learning resources for myself and potentially other like-minded individuals attempting to learn Rust and Bevy.
